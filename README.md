# Life-Below-React-Native-
I prefer for you to try this on windows because i havent tested if it works properly on linux
(also preffered to be run on ios but it also runs on android)

HOW TO RUN
1. Download the Expo Go on your mobile phone from the app store AND MAKE SURE YOUR MOBILE PHONE AND PC ARE CONNECTED TO THE SAME WIFI
2. Download and extract the repository to a location you know
3. Open windows powershell (or terminal if on linux)
4. With the cd command enter the repository LifeBelow
5. (if you dont have node js installed go to the website and install the LTS latest version, you can check your nodeJS version using the command node -v so that you have AT LEAST 18.18 version of nodejs)
6. now run npm install -g expo-cli (if this doesnt work, run powershell as administrator and run this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser)
7. now run npm install (to download the project's dependencies)
8. now run npx expo install expo-location
9. now run npx expo install react-native-maps
10. now run npx expo start to start the app
11. next open your phone and scan the QR code which pops up in the terminal and it should take you to the application
12. Enjoy using the prototype!
